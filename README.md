## How Emory works?

1. Step 1: You must always sign in to use the app. It is for confidential purposes. If you did not have an account, please sign up.
2. Step 2: You can select Mood for any day you want, add Actions related to your Mood, spill your mind in the Note and add a memorable picture representing your day. 
3. Step 3: All the Diary items you made are saved according to day and month. You can look back at all the memories you created.
4. Step 4: Look out at the Mood Graph, where your mood fluctuation is displayed. Don’t let the graph go down!
5. Step 5: If you have a list of things to do, TodoList will be there to help. Add tasks, deadlines and things you might forget to the list. Turn on reminder and you are on schedule!
